Because I couldn't install a newer compiler version of gcc, and was still on gcc4.4 stuck I guess that is the reason why it was always way slower then the version in exc1.

But I noticed that in the lower vector size the vectorization with intristics has a better speedup, but on the larger vectors it has almost no speedup. I think that is because the intristics version can only calculate with 4 floats at a time but the auto vec is much faster, because it actually can do more then just 4 at a time. But the overhead of setting it up is less therefore it has better speedup on low vectorsizes but on larger vectors the speedup is just worth the setup.


The interesting event of perf stat is rC710:u, which is the number of vector instructions retired.
The number of vector instructions retired in the vectorized version is a quarter of the reference version, 
which is expected, as 4 floats fit into one vector instruction.

The output of perf stat for SIMD_INST_RETIRED.VECTOR is:
