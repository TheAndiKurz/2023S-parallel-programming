Explanation omp collapse(n):
For independant rectangular nested loops it may be the case that different iterations take a different ammount of time,
or the outer loop is less than the number of threads active which can lead to some threads being idle.
collapse will split this nested for into iterations for every index combination and distribute those iterations over the number of threads.
this will lead to a more even load distribution and might improve performance.

The n specifies the nesting depth to which collapsing should be applied so one can choose to only collapse the first 2 loops of a tripple nested loop.

Triangular loops (e.g a logarithmic loop where the inner loop iterates outerloop/2 times per outer iteration) are more
difficult to collapse and the collapse pragma is not suitable for this.
