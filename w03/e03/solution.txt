To archive best performance, the padding should be set, that it fills the remaining cache line. 
In this case the size of variable is 8 byes. Assuming a cache line has 64 bytes, the padding should be 56 bytes.

The version using a private variable is the fastest.
Using the 56 byte padding comes close in time.
Don't using padding results in a speed decrease, when increasing the number of threads.

Using a private variable, results in 0% cache-miss rate.
Using no padding has a 1.5% miss rate and using the full cache line again reduces miss rate to 0.
