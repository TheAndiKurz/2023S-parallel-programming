To archive best performance, the padding should be set, that it fills the remaining cache line. 
In this case the size of variable is 8 byes. Assuming a cache line has 64 bytes, the padding should be 56 bytes.

The version using a private variable is the fastest and also has the best approximation.
Using the 56 byte padding comes close in time and also has a better approximation, as when using no padding.

Using the padded array also has the best cache-miss rate of 5.2%, outperforming both other versions (8.4% no padding, 6% local sum).
