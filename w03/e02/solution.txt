Improvements: 
  - Matrix initialization could also be done in parallel. (will not improve the time)
  - make sure that  local_res can not introduce false sharing(padding)
  - split matrix into blocks for the multiplication step (smaller matrix block gets multiplied at a time)
  - remove uneeded parallel region which lead to all the work being done by the main thread
  - add schedule(guided) for improved load balancing
