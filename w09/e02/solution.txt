The loops at lines 10, 17 and 25 were vectorized successfully
whereas loops 22 and 27 were not.

The loop at line 22 could not be vectorized because the offset is not affine.
Due to the nature of this loop (using modulo and argc) The compiler can not determine the offset at which the array is accessed
and can therefore not vectorize this loop. With modulo we might introduce data dependencies and therefore this operation can not be vectorized.

The loop at line 27 fails due to the use of printf() which clobbers memmory, meaning printf does not know which memory locations
might be accessed during its execution.

The compiler performs various analyses beyond checking for dependencies and semantic correctness.

    Analyzing loop nests and loop forms.
    Determining the number of loop iterations.
    Analyzing data references and scalar cycles.
    Determining precisions and performing pattern recognition.
    Analyzing data reference accesses and marking relevant statements to be vectorized.
    Analyzing data reference dependences.
