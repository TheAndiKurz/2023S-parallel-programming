-   For c arrays are stored in row major order. That means consecutive row iteration will lead
    to the least ammount of cache misses which will only be cold misses whenever a new line is accessed. 

    When the Hadamart product is performed in row major order f can be calculated as follows:

    f_ij(n, s) = n * n * 4 / s  # calculate the number of cache lines needed to access the whole matrix

    Set associativity does not change cache performance for sequential read.


-   For column major order f will be the following:

    We assume n to be significantly larger than s (n >> s). In the worst case this will lead to a 
    cache miss for every acessed element, as every cache line is only accessed a long time after it was previously accessed.

    f_ji(n, s) = n * n # calculate the number of elements in the matrix


The theoretical expected cache miss rates could not be confirmed on the lcc. No idea why.
