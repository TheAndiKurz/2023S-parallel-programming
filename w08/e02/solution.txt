For this exercise the general workflow was to run the profiler with the programm to see which
function was dominating the execution time at first this was quite helpful but at some point the most
runtime intense parts of the program were those that either, weren't parallelizable or were already
optimized to my best knowledge. At that point I just started looking through the code to find
loops that were worth parallelizing.
